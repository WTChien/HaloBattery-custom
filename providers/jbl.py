"""JBL Quantum 910 Wireless over USB/HID, without JBL QuantumENGINE.

Protocol from plugato/JBL_Baterry_Monitor, which reads this headset on Linux for
exactly this USB id (0ecb:2088):

  * the headset pushes its own reports on the receiver's vendor collection
    (ff13:0001, reported on interface 5 by a real unit); there is no request to send.
    The battery arrives as report id 0x08 with the level in byte 1 - the pattern that
    project confirmed against the hardware ([Report ID, Battery%] -> 08 1e = 30%).
  * report id 0x2f carries the microphone mute state, not a level.
  * the headset can stay quiet for a long time, so the last level heard is kept and
    shown greyed out until something arrives again - the project reaches for the
    headset's own buttons to make it talk, and a probe here does the same by
    reporting what it saw.

Charging is not in the frame that carries the level, so none is reported.
